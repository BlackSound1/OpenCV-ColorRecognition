# OpenCV Color Recognition

This repo represents some experiments I did with color recognition in OpenCV.

This is primarily just to teach myself some OpenCV

Contains 2 scripts:

1. `HSV_color_picker.py` A color picker UI with HSV sliders. Courtesy of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t71sQ6WY7L4
2. `color_recognition.py` A script to connect to a webcam, open a window with the webcam's feed,
and recognize the color of whatever is placed in the center of the frame. This is a modified version of what's shown in the above link.
